# Chatbot
I created a chatbot app using Java and Modern Android Development (MAD) tools in Android Studio. The app features a responsive interface and real-time interactions, simulating conversations with a virtual assistant. This project showcases the integration of natural language processing and a smooth user experience on Android.
